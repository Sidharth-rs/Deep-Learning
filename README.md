# Deep-Learning
This repo will contain few deep learning projects which will use basic models to train the dataset 
1) Image captioning : I have predicted the correct caption for the particular image , in this code EPOCHS=5 , you can change it according to your needs , the higher the EPOCHS the better the model will train and accuracy will be high . Here I have used CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) , Encoder and a Decoder while building the model .
